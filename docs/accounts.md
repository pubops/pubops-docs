In Pubops we have user profiles and publisher accounts. User profiles are your personal accounts with your name and login information. You, as a user, can create and manage multiple publisher accounts. A publisher account can be managed by multiple users, ie. collaborators. A publisher account can contain multiple properties. When you register for Pubops you will be prompted to create your first publisher account unless you have been invited to collaborate on an existing account.

## How can I manage multiple accounts?

You can always create more than one publisher account. This can be useful if you want to split management of your properties under different teams or business units where each will have its own list of collaborators and their own business settings.

If you need to create a new account you follow these steps:

1. In the top-right corner click on your profile.
2. Click on the **Create new account** in the dropdown menu.
3. Complete the account creation form.

Once that's done you will be switched to your new account. To switch between different accounts click on your avatar in the top-right corner and choose another account from the list in the dropdown menu.

## How to manage collaborators?

Each publisher account can have multiple collaborators. To invite or remove collaborators go to [Account Settings](https://pubops.io/publisher/account) and look for **Collaborators** form. From there you can invite collaborators by email. You can remove any existing collaborators or any pending invites. Each account must have at least one user managing it.

:::note
For now each collaborator is assigned Administrator role, so make sure you trust the people that you add. Having more granular control of permissions is on our roadmap.

## How to cancel a publisher account?

In case you need to delete a publisher account you can do so from the [Account Settings](https://pubops.io/publisher/account). This action cannot be reversed.

## How to cancel my user profile?

To cancel your user profile head over to your [Profile Settings](https://pubops.io/publisher/profile) and look for **User Cancellation** section. Once you've cancelled your user profile you will lose access to all publisher accounts and won't be able to login to Pubops. This action cannot be reversed.
