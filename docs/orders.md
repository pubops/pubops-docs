## How do orders work?

Orders can be created either by publishers or by advertisers through self-serve booking portal.

## How to create a manual order?

Manual orders can be useful when you want to set up an order for client by yourself. All manual orders are automatically approved once you've created them. Just as with orders that come from self-serve booking portal, manual orders will also show up in your advertisers self-serve portal so that they can manage creatives and see delivery stats.

1. To create a manual order just go to Orders page and click **Create order**.
2. Choose advertiser.
3. Give a meaningful name for your order.
4. Choose which property...
5. Use calendar and country selector of the booking interface to request inventory availability and configure campaign line items.
6. Click **Create** once you are happy with your selection.

## How to negotiate orders?

Currently we don't have negotiation functionality within Pubops, however it is on our roadmap.

## How to process self-serve orders?

All self-serve orders need to be reviewed before they go live. You will receive an email when a new order has been made. All orders including those that are un-reviewed will show up in the Orders page. When reviewing orders your main objective is to verify that advertiser conforms to your standards and that you can and willing to fulfill the order.

If you unable or don't want to fulfill some line items, you can cancel them and approve the rest of the order. If some creatives are missing or need to be changed you can still approve the order and deal with creatives later. Line items with missing or unapproved creatives won't serve until resolved.

Accepting an order will reserve inventory for all un-canceled line items.

## How to edit an order?

Currently we don't support editing orders. The only thing you can do is pause or cancel line items. You can also cancel the whole order and recreate it. In such cases you may want to duplicate it to speed up the process.

## How to cancel a line item?

Sometimes you may need to cancel some line items in yet to be approved or already approved orders. It can happen because you are unable or don't want to fulfill specific item. To do so simply click on "Cancel" in the line item's menu. All undelivered impressions will show up as credit note in the order's balance. It's your responsibility to process refunds if needed. This action cannot be undone.

## How to cancel an order?

To cancel an order just open the order and click **Cancel order** from the menu. All undelivered impressions will show up as credit note in the order's balance. It's your responsibility to process refunds if needed. This action cannot be undone.

## How to pause a line item?

Generally it's not a good idea to pause line items for direct sold campaigns because they can end up being underdelivered. If you are pausing line item because creative needs to be changed a better workflow is to disapprove that creative so that advertiser will get notified about it and revise it. For line items that are connected to your ad server, rejected creatives won't serve, and once approved will start serving again. However if you still wish to pause line items you can do so by pressing **Pause** in the line item's menu.

## How to duplicate an order?

Duplicating an order is often much more convenient that creating a new order especially if all you need to do is change a few parameters. To duplicate an order simply navigate to your existing order and click on **Duplicate order** in the order's menu.
