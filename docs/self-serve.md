A self-serve advertising platform allows advertisers to easily book and manage their ad campaigns without troubling publishers with inquiry emails, ad server trafficking, creative updates, billing and so on. This means that advertisers are able to get answers for their booking and reporting needs faster and set up campaigns in a more efficient manner. As for publishers it means that a lot of sales tasks that they were previously doing manually can now be automated. It noy only saves time for publishers but actually allows for more sales as the workflows are now much more optimized and welcoming for advertisers.
